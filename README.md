3D Game using the Unity engine

This repository purely exists to store my C# scripts for a Unity game for the Android and iOS. Due to Intellectual property issues, I cannot display the entire files here (also because it is 3.4GB).  

The game is 3D third person shooter and will be available for beta testing towards the end of the year. Hopefully, we will be able to port the game to the Occulus Rift and increase user experience. Check back here till then ! 

For now, this repo is just meant  to store our scripts =)

Thanks,
Tim Manas and the crew
